## Home_Sales

In this challenge, we use SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then we'll use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

It contains the files to analyze home sales data with amd without spark.
